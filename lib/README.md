# SIToolBox Data

 This subdirectory contains the SIToolbox library files. Initially it will be an empty directory. After running ./compile.sh it will store two library files namely libslatec.a and libsubroutines.a. Users who like to write their own packages using the callable SIToolbox subroutines need to include these libraries while compiling their codes.
